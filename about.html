    <h2>About Us: WeTradeShoes</h2>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>WeTradeShoes was born out of a simple love for sneakers. What started as friends swapping kicks and helping each
    other
    find rare pairs has grown into a community where anyone can buy, sell, or trade shoes with confidence.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>We want to make sneaker trading feel personal and trustworthy, connecting people who share the same passion for
    style, culture, and self-expression.</p>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>To build a world where sneaker lovers everywhere can connect, share stories, and grow their collections without
    limits.</p>

    <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>Were not just a company, were sneakerheads just like you. Our team is made up of collectors, dreamers, and
    everyday people who believe every pair tells a story. Together, were here to make sure your next trade is more than
    just a transactionâ€”its part of the journey.</p>
